we will decide to use the scientfic method for this
research question:
Can a network of low-cost, dual-frequency(likely better if triple frequency?)positioning stations be used to reliably measure Total Electron Content (TEC) in the ionosphere and detect meaningful patterns in space weather activity

significance:
The ionosphere, a dynamic region of Earth’s upper atmosphere, plays a critical role in how radio signals travel. Its electron density, measured as Total Electron Content (TEC), varies based on solar radiation, geomagnetic storms, and diurnal cycles.
Fluctuations in TEC can disrupt satellite-based navigation, communication systems, and aviation. While global models and government observatories track space weather at scale, this project explores whether community-operated, ground-based receivers can contribute localized, real-time ionospheric insights — especially in under-observed regions.

3. hypothesis:
By capturing dual-frequency L-band signals and analyzing their relative delay, it is possible to derive accurate TEC values and observe ionospheric variability. I anticipate clear correlations between TEC variation and solar activity, geomagnetic indices, and daily atmospheric cycles.
this one is perhaps unbothered by whether we use dual frequency or triple band
