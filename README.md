# Space-weather
we must first decide that the scope of this project is to act as a bridge
there are people who will use the raw data for space weather research, trend analysis, predcition etc
there are people who will use it to determine radio wave latency or loss
that in itself can branch off in many different eays. one example is just automated farming where accurate position is required. this need isnt satisfied by currenrt technology like gps satelites. with the addition of telemetry data we can provide it can be fixed
